I have a moderate hatred toward Javascript. I'm not saying they're bad or anything, in fact they're good, too good. And that's why I hate them, people invest too much on Javascript as if everyone used it and abandont CSS (I'm especially talking about [has()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has){:target="_blank"}). Making both user and developer dependent on Javascript. It's can be difficult to have a good, feature-rich website without having to use some Javascript.
